# moodle-rubric-self-assessment
Self assessment rubric for moodle

# Description:
Allows students to perform a self assessment on any assignment that uses a rubric advanced grading grid.

# Install instructions:
Unzip the contents of this folder into your moodle folder. The 'grade' folder should be in the root level directory of your moodle install. 

All of the files for this module live in grade/grading/form/rubric and will overwrite any files in that location so make sure you take a backup of your moodle installation (files plus database) before experimenting with this plugin.

# Usage instructions
When you define or edit a rubric, you'll get an extra option for 'enable self assessment'.
This will allow students to click on the preview rubric to indicate the grade they think they're working at.
These self assessment grades will then be visible to the teacher when they grade the students work.
